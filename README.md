This repository will hold the first steps into system engineering and networks.

# Simplified Technical Concepts

## 🌐 Question #0 - What is a server?

### 🔍 Simple Definition
A server is a device, virtual appliance, or computer program that provides functionality to other programs or devices called "clients".

### ⚙️ How it works
- **Request**: A client sends a request to the server for information or services.
- **Processing**: The server receives the request, processes it, and checks permissions if necessary.
- **Response**: The server returns the requested information to the client.

### 🍽️ Analogy
Think of a server as a maître d' in a restaurant:
- The client (user) makes an order (request).
- The maître d' (server) goes to the kitchen (file system) to retrieve the dish (content).
- It then serves the dish to the customer (sends the response).

### 📚 Examples of servers
- File server: Manages the storage and sharing of documents.
- Mail server: Manages the sending and receiving of emails.

### 🔑 Importance
Servers are essential for the operation of computer networks, because they allow clients to access resources and services.

## 🌐 Question #1 - What is a web server?

### 🔍 Simple definition
A web server is a software or physical device that serves web pages to users via the HTTP protocol.

### ⚙️ How it works
- **Request**: When a user enters a URL in their browser, an HTTP request is sent to the web server.
- **Processing**: The server identifies the requested file and retrieves it.
- **Response**: The server sends the web page to the user's browser.

### 🍽️ Analogy
Think of a web server as a maître d' in a restaurant:
- He takes your order (request).
- Gets your food (web page).
- Serves it to you (displays it in the browser).

### 📚 Examples of web servers
- **Apache**: One of the most widely used web servers, known for its flexibility.
- **Nginx**: Renowned for its high performance and efficient resource management.

### 🔑 Importance
Web servers are crucial for accessing websites and online applications.

## 🌐 Question #2 - What is a codebase?

### 🔍 Simple definition
A codebase is the complete collection of source code used to build a software system.

### ⚙️ How it works
- Contains all the files needed to develop and maintain the software.
- Allows developers to work on different parts of the software in a coordinated manner.

### 🍽️ Analogy
It's like a complete cooking recipe:
- All the ingredients (files) are together.
- All the steps (functions) are described.

### 📚 Codebase examples
- Codebase of an open source project on GitHub.
- Codebase of a mobile application developed by a team.

### 🔑 Importance
The codebase is essential to ensure that the software works properly and can be updated or improved.

## 🌐 Question #3 - What is a database?

### 🔍 Simple definition
A database is a collection of information stored and organized to be easily accessible, updated, and managed.

### ⚙️ How it works
- Stores data in a structured form.
- Allows operations like searching, adding, and modifying data.

### 🍽️ Analogy
Imagine a well-organized library:
- Books (data) are categorized.
- You can easily find, add, or modify books.

### 📚 Examples of databases
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system.
- **MongoDB**: Document-oriented NoSQL database.

### 🔑 Importance
Databases are essential for efficiently managing information in modern applications.

## 🌐 Question #4 - What is a DNS?

### 🔍 Simple definition
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates domain names into IP addresses.

### ⚙️ How it works
- When a user types in a URL, DNS locates the corresponding IP address.
- Allows browsers to access the appropriate web servers.

### 🍽️ Analogy
It's like a phone book:
- You look up a name (domain).
- DNS gives you the corresponding number (IP address).

### 📚 Examples of DNS
- Public DNS servers like Google DNS (8.8.8.8).
- DNS systems used by Internet Service Providers.

### 🔑 Importance
DNS is crucial for browsing the Internet because it allows you to use easy-to-remember names instead of numeric IP addresses.

## 🌐 Question #5 - What is HTTPS?

### 🔍 Simple Definition
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that encrypts communications between the browser and the web server.

### ⚙️ Fonctionnement
- Chiffre les données échangées pour protéger la confidentialité.
- Utilise des certificats SSL/TLS pour établir une connexion sécurisée.

### 🍽️ Analogie
C'est comme envoyer une lettre dans une enveloppe scellée :
- Le contenu est protégé contre les regards indiscrets.
  
### 📚 Exemples d'utilisation d'HTTPS
- Sites bancaires en ligne qui traitent des informations sensibles.
- Plateformes e-commerce qui protègent les données des clients.

### 🔑 Importance
HTTPS est essentiel pour sécuriser les transactions en ligne et protéger la vie privée des utilisateurs sur Internet.

## 🌐 Question #6 - What is TCP/IP?

### 🔍 Simple Definition
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of protocols used to interconnect network devices over the Internet or any private network.

### ⚙️ How it works
- Defines how data should be packaged, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

### 🍽️ Analogy
Think of it like the rules of the road on the highway:
- How "cars" (data) move across the network.

### 📚 Examples of TCP/IP usage
- Used whenever you browse the web or send an email.

### 🔑 Importance
TCP/IP is fundamental to the functioning of the Internet, as it allows communication between different types of devices and networks.

## 🌐 Question #5 - What is HTTPS?

### 🔍 Simple Definition
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that encrypts communications between the browser and the web server.

### ⚙️ How it works
- Encrypts data exchanged to protect confidentiality.
- Uses SSL/TLS certificates to establish a secure connection.

### 🍽️ Analogy
It's like sending a letter in a sealed envelope:
- The contents are protected from prying eyes.

### 📚 Examples of HTTPS use cases
- Online banking sites that handle sensitive information.
- E-commerce platforms that protect customer data.

### 🔑 Importance
HTTPS is essential for securing online transactions and protecting users' privacy on the Internet.
